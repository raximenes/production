# 03_markov_model.R (Updated)
#
# Purpose:
#   This script defines the core Markov modeling functions for a model that
#   explicitly separates states by vaccination status, including:
#     1) run_markov_model() -> computes the distribution of the cohort across
#        states over the model cycles.
#     2) make_cost_matrix() -> constructs the (n_cycles+1) x n_states cost matrix,
#        with age-specific costs for all IMD infection states, for both vaccinated
#        and unvaccinated.
#     3) make_utility_vector() -> creates the vector of utilities for each state.
#     4) compute_costs_and_qalys() -> multiplies the Markov trace by cost & utility,
#        applies discounting, and returns total discounted costs & QALYs.
#
# Important:
#   - We now have separate healthy states: "Healthy_vaccinated" & "Healthy_unvaccinated".
#   - We also have 8 infection states total, e.g.: "SeroB_Infect_vacc"/"SeroB_Infect_unvacc", etc.
#   - Sequela states remain the same, and we have two death states.
#
# Make sure these are consistent with the states in build_transition_array().
